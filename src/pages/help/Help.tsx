        <h2>FAQ/HELP :</h2>
        <h3>Filters</h3>
        <h4>How does the basic filter works?</h4>
        <p>The filter allows you to filter for desired posts or users. </p>
        <p>
          For posts, you can filter by "matching keywords" (case insensitive and
          can accept multiple words), or by whether the post has images
        </p>
        <p>
          For users you can filter by location, gender, age, and whether you
          followed them.
        </p>

        <h4>What are cross-filters ?</h4>
        <p>
          You can apply users criteria to posts, and vice versa. The
          cross-filter criteria are shown below the main criteria.
        </p>

        <p>
          - If you are on the post-feed page, applying USER criteria will only
          show posts FROM users having the matched criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
          - If you are on the users page, applying POST criteria will only show
          users who HAVE MADE the posts having the matched criteria.
        </p>

        <h4>Can I mix and match the filters?</h4>
        <p>
          You can definitely apply more than 1 criteria on the filter. In this
          case, only the posts/users/ that satisfies all the criteria will be
          shown.
        </p>

        <h4>Can I apply the post filter to the users page, and vice versa?</h4>

        <p>
          Yes, if you check box the "", then the criteria will be apply to the
          other page (ie, to the users page if you are on posts page).
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you navigate to the other page, you will see the criteria already
          applied.
        </p>

        <h4>How to unapply filter</h4>
        <p>
          On the filter page, click on the "clear" button on the bottom right.
          This will cancel all applied criteria.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I see the "followed" users?</h3>
        <p>
          As we are an "open world" app, by default you will see everything. To
          see only the users you followed, use the filter, and check the
          "followed" box.
        </p>

        <h3>Why am I seeing empty chats?</h3>

        <p>
          Everytime someone click into chat with you or if you click into chat
          with someone, a new chat is created and will show up on both you and
          the other person's chatlist. This is not a bug, but a feature!
        </p>

        <h3>Are there notification for chat?</h3>

        <p>
          We have not implemented that feature. However, if you go to the chat
          list page, all incoming chats should be updated realtime.
        </p>

        <h3>How can I remove my posts?</h3>
        <p>
          You can do so either on the post page, or your profile view. On the
          post page, all your posts will have a trash icon on top right. On your
          own profile view, you will see all your posts with the trash icon
          below your profile information
        </p>
        <h3>Can I remove my profile?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Unfortunately we haven't had the time to implement that feature.
          If you are worried about your data, see "Privacy policy" section
          below.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I remove my comment?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Unfortunately we haven't had the time to implement that feature.
          So don't write comment you may regret about!
        </p>

        <h3>Why do I see only 20 posts?</h3>
        <p>
          We limit to only the 20 most recents posts, to avoid request overload.
        </p>
        <p>
          To see older/other posts that interest you, please use the filter
          feature, which will return another 20 recent posts by matching
          criteria.
        </p>

        <h3>Additional help</h3>
        <p>You can ask Alex, Johnny or Sean on demo day via Discord. </p>
